Code for Different Variations of Josephus Problem

The files Jospehus.c and Josephus_Graph.c are C implementations for the two algorithms stated in the report

Josephus.c - Modular Arithmetic and Recursive Approach

Josephus_Graph.c - Graph Theory Approch

Josephus_with_Revivals.c - It is a variation of Josephus Problem that has been implemeted in C to show its property

Josephus_in_Multidimension.c - It is a variation of Josephus Problem that has been implemeted in C to show its property
The elimination is done on k-1 basis right now

All the other python files are for interactive implementations of Josephus Problem and its Variations

For running these files please the steps below

Please first install turtle to run the graphics in python

For installing use:

pip install PythonTurtle

The graphics will run in separate file
